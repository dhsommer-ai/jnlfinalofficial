        <p>Money.</p>
        <p>It used to be essentially outlawed for college athletes. They couldn’t take endorsement deals or be compensated for anything related to their participation in the NCAA. The main sources of university spending on athletics were on facilities, coaches, and athletic directors. Now, it’s all about the players.</p>
        <p>Name, image, and likeness (NIL) were not able to be profited off of until 2021. However, since a 2025 antitrust case was overturned, high school athletes are now legally able to negotiate endorsement deals including deals with the universities themselves before committing. For many recruits in high school, the competition between the schools turns into a bidding war more than a recruitment battle where coaches and development are the main focus because of the low likelihood of college athletes going pro.</p>
        <p>“Spending in college athletics is out of control,” said Fanatics Vice President and former College Licensing Company agent Derek Eiler. “There’s no salary cap and no structure. It’s every [school] for themselves.” </p>
        <p> Eiler’s argument holds strong for many college sports fans who believe that student-athletes need to be getting a better education. Over the past 20 years, schools in the SEC (college football’s highest earning conference) have seen a direct correlation in total school spending compared to their football spending.
</p>
 <div style="min-height:626px" id="datawrapper-vis-7h7AE"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7h7AE/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-7h7AE"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7h7AE/full.png" alt="SEC Universities Total Expenses vs Football Spending (2005-2024) (Line chart)" /></noscript></div>
        <p>The most recent data shows us that almost 40% of SEC university spending goes directly toward football expenses. Eiler says that this is because of the legitimate NIL funds allocated towards schools not being enough to compete with other high level programs. These ‘legitimate’ NIl deals can include  endorsements, advertising campaigns, or even being in video games to promote the school’s or player’s name, image, and/or likeness. All SEC schools are allocated roughly $20.5 million in an attempt to ensure that spending remains fair. But there’s always loopholes.</p>
        <p>In today’s college football world, Eiler says a top 10 college football program is usually spending around $45 million on their roster. But how? Eiler said that players (some of whom may not even be committed to the school yet) can be paid in the triple digits for going to meetings or dinners with donors to the athletic programs and other high-level investors. Right now, there is very little crackdown on this because at the end of the day, it’s making everybody at the top more money and making the players more money, but it comes at the cost of the true academic value the universities are meant to offer these student-athletes.</p>
        <p>Another value that is seemingly diminishing in today’s game is the coaching student-athletes receive. Earlier, I mentioned how student-athletes are sometimes the subject of a bidding war between schools. Coaches are too. Lane Kiffin, former Alabama assistant and Ole Miss head coach, has just accepted the largest contact in head coaching history for LSU, a direct rival of both of those two schools. That’s also an even bigger deal when you take into consideration that he turned Ole Miss, a team that never used to be a contender, into a surefire playoff team. Now, Kiffin isn’t even allowed to coach them in their biggest game in school history. These coaches are also in it for the money when they used to be in it for player development and proving they deserved to be NFL level. With the money college coaches are receiving now, there’s little reason to want to make the jump from college head coach to NFL coordinator.</p>

   <div style="min-height:482px" id="datawrapper-vis-uqpOJ"><script type="text/javascript" defer src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uqpOJ/embed.js" charset="utf-8" data-target="#datawrapper-vis-uqpOJ"></script><noscript><img src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/uqpOJ/full.png" alt="SEC Universities Coach Salaries vs Football Spending (2005-2024) (Line chart)" /></noscript></div>

        <p>So what’s the solution? How do we ensure the academic <em> and </em> financial integrity of college sports while keeping it profitable and as attracting as it is right now? Some fans think that college football is better than the NFL, and that shouldn’t be a bad thing. However, when money is the first thing on everybody’s minds, greed can take over the sport.</p>
        <p>Eiler says that there needs to be a CBA (collective bargaining agreement) of sorts, but he asks “How do you collectively bargain with so many sports at every school?” Eiler, a parent of two students at ACC schools, was disgusted to hear that schools across the country were added to the ACC: “Should Syracuse volleyball be travelling to Berkeley on a Tuesday Night?” He says that football has “subsidized” the other sports that schools offer and has hurt sports with a lower budget more than it has helped football and basketball make more money.</p>
        <p>Overall, the college sports landscape is changing. It will continue to evolve in an unpredictable way because there will always be somebody with an idea to make more money. However, the NCAA will hit a breaking point and start to regulate NIL more. What happens at the standoff between the NCAA versus athletic directors and commissioners will shape the long-term future of college sports, which, in turn, will affect the long-term academic landscape of universities across the country.</p>
